## Overview

### Concept
The project began with an idea: to create a dashboard webapp that I would enjoy using on a daily basis. I gained a lot of inspiration from the [Currently](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/currently/ojhmphdkpgbibohbnpbfiefkgieacjmh) and [Momentum](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/momentum/laookkfknpbbblfpciffpaejjkokdgca) extensions for new tabs.


### Tech Stack
My app will begin as a deployable fullstack app using Node/Express, React, MongoDB(pending decision on whether a DB is necessary for this), and a handful of APIS. Due to the reliance on APIs, the server will be required in order to monitor requests to authenticated APIs to prevent malicious attacks. After all base features are implemented and deployed, I will begin porting the code to the chrome webstore.
